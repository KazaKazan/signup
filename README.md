This is a sign-up page mock-up made for the curricilum of The Odin Project.

Currently;

* It meets all the requirements of the assignment, although the wording of certain things are changed a bit and some extras have been added.
* It has form validation.
* It tries to meet all the best practices of online forms I can think of such as:
    * Only the absolutely necessary information is required (E-Mail, Password and Password Confirmation fields).
    * Each field has a card that explains what will the information be used for and what are the equirements for the input if there's any.
    * The form legend and labels are descriptive for screen readers and the form respects tab order.
    * The submit button is not enabled until all requirements are met.
    * Form validation doesn't kick in while the user is still inputting, reducing form anxiety.

In the future I would like to;

* Make it more responsive and support mobile devices.
* Add validation to the e-mail field.
* Perhaps add a successful submission page and make the terms & conditions and the privacy policy links display cards with mock information.
* Make a mock sign-in page for the sign-in link to redirect to.
* Perhaps make a mock homepage.
